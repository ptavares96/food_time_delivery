Forecasting delivery durations is a key challenge for food delivery services. A top strategy involves gauging the geographical span between pickup and drop-off locations. This informs delivery time predictions using historical data on past deliveries of similar distances.

Time delivery prediction mainly falls under regression modeling. It anticipates continuous numeric outputs based on input features. For instance, predicting delivery time involves considering factors like delivery person attributes, location, order type, and vehicle.

Various regression techniques are available:

Linear Regression: For linear relationships between inputs and targets.
Random Forest Regression: Ideal for non-linear patterns and complex interactions.
Gradient Boosting Regression: Sequential trees for precise predictions.
Support Vector Regression (SVR): Effective for non-linear data.
These techniques offer diverse benefits, ensuring a comprehensive toolbox for crafting accurate time delivery prediction models.
